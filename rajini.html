    Rajinikanth (born December 12, 1950, Bangalore, Mysore [now Bengaluru, Karnataka], India) is an Indian actor whose unique mannerisms and stylized line delivery made him one of the leading stars of Tamil cinema. With roles in 170 films, he also enjoyed considerable success in Hindi, Telugu, and Kannada movies. Known for his charismatic screen presence and the extreme adulation he receives from fans who call him Thalaivar or “superstar,” Rajinikanth is widely regarded as a pop cultural phenomenon. His brand of cinema is distinguished by powerful social messaging, often told through exaggerated plot devices verging on the ludicrous.
    He completed his primary education at the Gavipuram Government Kannada Model Primary School. After his sixth grade, Rajinikanth joined the Acharya Pathshala Public School. During this time, he spent a lot of time acting in plays. After completing his education, Shivaji had to work several odd jobs including a carpenter and coolie. Later, he got a job as the bus conductor in the Bangalore Transport service.

In 1973, he joined the Madras Film Institute to take an acting course. His friend, Raj Bahadur, financially supported him.  During this time, Tamil Director, K Balachander noticed him. On his advice, Rajinikanth learned Tamil and began his career in the industry. His had a small role in his first film, Apoorva Raggangal. After a couple of small roles, he was cast for a lead in Moondru Mudichu. The audience experienced the Rajni style flipping of cigarette for the first time in this film.
